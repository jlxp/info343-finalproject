## Info 343 - Winter 2018
### Final Project
### Maddie, Joy and Tara

#### Project Idea: Online, multi-player Cards Against Humanity Game

Here is an [an example](https://github.com/jlxp/PretendYoureXyzzy) code repository for a similar game.
We will adjust the card content to be all info/UW jokes to keep the game appropriate and funny for the intended audience.

##### What we will build:
Players will enter the game room by entering a nickname which will be stored in Firebase. The game will take anywhere between 3-5 players. We will have a list of constants that represent the cards and their contents. Users will have 5 cards in their hand and can pick which one to play for the given subject card. The person with the subject card will rotate and they will choose whichever card they believe is the most funny for that round and the person who played that card's score will improve. The game will end once someone has 5 points, but users can quit the game at anytime. We will implement a chat room similar to the one in the example if we have extra time and want an additonal challenge.

##### Who will do what:
* Maddie will work on game logic and click events, controlling who is currently playing.
* Joy will focus on game logic and card rendering.
* Tara will on managing state and current game status.
* We will all develop the card content so that there are sufficient cards.

##### Frameworks and Libraries:
* We will use the shuffle algorithm used in the tiles game.
* We will use Bootstrap for formatting purposes.
